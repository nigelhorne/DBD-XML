# DBD-XMLSimple
Access XML data view the DBI Interface

Sadly DBD::AnyData doesn't work with the latest DBI and DBD::AnyData2 isn't
out yet, so I am writing this pending the publication of DBD::AnyData2

DBD-XMLSimple doesn't yet expect to support complex XML data, so that's why
it's not called DBD-XML.
